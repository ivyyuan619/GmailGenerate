# GmailGenerate

This project is a Streamlit web application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate email content based on user input.

Features
1. Generate professional emails using AI.
2. Simple and interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
3. Visualization of word clouds based on generated email content.

#Installation
Prerequisites

step
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ivyyuan619/GmailGenerate.git
cd completed_code_7_24.py

2.Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. If requirements.txt is not available, you can install the dependencies manually:
pip install openai streamlit pandas wordcloud matplotlib langchain langchain_community

4. Set up the OpenAI API key:
Replace "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" with your actual OpenAI API key in the script.


To write a README file for your completed_code_7_24.py script, we need to first understand what the code does. Let's take a look at the content of your script and then draft a README based on its functionality.

I'll start by examining the script.

Based on the initial portion of the script, it seems like your code uses the OpenAI API to generate email content based on user input. The script also includes Streamlit for building the web interface and other libraries for handling data and visualization.

Here is a draft of a README file for your script:
